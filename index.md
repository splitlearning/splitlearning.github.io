# Distributed deep learning and inference without sharing raw data #
## MIT Alliance for Distributed and Private Machine Learning 

**Abstract:** Friction in data sharing is a large challenge for large scale machine learning. Recently techniques such as Federated Learning, Differential Privacy and Split Learning aim to address siloed and unstructured data, privacy and regulation of data sharing and incentive models for data transparent ecosystems. Split learning is a new technique developed at the MIT Media Lab’s Camera Culture group that allows for participating entities to train machine learning models without sharing any raw data.

### New Program: MIT Alliance for Distributed and Private Machine Learning

The program will explore the main challenges in data friction that make capture, analysis and deployment of AI technologies.
The challenges include siloed and unstructured data, privacy and regulation of data sharing and incentive models for data transparent ecosystems. The research program with study automated machine learning (AutoML), privacy preserving machine learning (PrivateML) and intrinsic as well as extrinsic data valuation (Data Markets). By working with a stakeholder and innovator network, we aim to create a standard for data transparent ecosystems that can simultaneously address the privacy and utility of data. Our broad focus would be on key technologies such as **Differential privacy, Federated Learning and Split Learning.**<br/>

The program members will meet 4 times a year, publish case studies of AI on siloed data, will develop a curated github archive and engage in privacy aware data sharing protocol discussion towards a data exchange standard. We expect this integrated program to lead to many publications, training of talent, new technologies and standards.<br/>

MIT Media Lab consortium members can join the alliance as a special interest group SIG member. Non-member companies, startups and non-profits can join via undirected research gift. To know more about the program, please contact at <i>vepakom(at)mit.edu</i>

## Split Learning and Inference:

Split learning removes barriers for collaboration in a whole range of sectors including healthcare, finance, security, logistics, governance, operations and manufacturing.
<p align="center"><a href=""><img src="https://splitlearning.github.io/diab1.png" height="320" width="600"></a></p>

For example, a split learning configuration as shown below allows for resource-constrained local hospitals with smaller individual datasets to collaborate and build a machine learning model that offers superior healthcare diagnostics, without sharing any raw data across each other as necessitated by trust, regulation and privacy.

**Landscape of related work:**
As shown below, split learning ideally fills the gap for being able to perform advanced AI tasks like training machine learning models in distributed settings with a substantial level of data protection.

**Key technical idea:** In the simplest of configurations of split learning, each client (for example, radiology center) trains a partial deep  network up to a specific layer known as the cut layer. The outputs at the cut layer are sent to another entity  (server/another client) which completes the rest of the training without looking at raw data from
any client that holds the raw data. This completes a round of forward propagation without sharing raw data. The gradients
are now back propagated again from its last layer until the cut layer in a similar fashion. The gradients at the
cut layer (and only these gradients) are sent back to radiology client centers. The rest of back
propagation is now completed at the radiology client centers. This process is continued until the
distributed split learning network is trained without looking at each others raw data.<br />

<h2 id="faq"> Frequently asked questions </h2>

1. **How does split learning work and what is new in our approach?** <br />
    Split learning attains high resource efficiency for distributed deep learning in comparison to existing methods by splitting the models architecture across distributed entities. It only communicates activations and gradients just from the split layer unlike other popular methods that share weights/gradients from all the layers. Split learning requires no raw data sharing; either of labels or features.


2. **How is raw data protected and who can get positively impacted?**<br />
    Split learning requires absolutely no raw data sharing. Sectors like healthcare, finance, security, surveillance and others where data sharing is prohibited will benefit from our approach for training distributed deep learning models. Another modality of split learning called NoPeek SplitNN also drastically reduces leakage due to any communicated activations by reducing their distance correlation with raw data while maintaining model performance via categorical cross-entropy.


3. **How long will it take to transition from laboratory setting to actual deployments between cooperating entities?**<br />
	The approach is easily deployable for inter and intra entity or organizational collaboration and is highly versatile in terms of possible network topologies. Due to its high resource efficiency in terms of computations, memory, communication bandwidth it is also naturally suitable for distributed learning where the clients are pervasive and ubiquitous edge devices like mobile phones or IOT devices as well as across larger devices and organizations.

## Split learning's computational and communication efficiency on clients:
Client-side communication costs are significantly reduced as the data to be
transmitted is restricted to initial layers of the split learning network (splitNN) prior to the split. The
client-side computation costs of learning the weights of the network are also
significantly reduced for the same reason. In terms of model performance, the
accuracies of Split NN remained competitive to other distributed deep learning methods like federated learning and large
batch synchronous SGD with a drastically smaller client side computational
burden when training on a larger number of clients as shown below in terms of teraflops of computation and gigabytes of communication when split learning is used to train Resnet and VGG architectures over 100 and 500 clients with CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets.

Versatile configurations of split learning configurations cater to various practical settings of **i) multiple entities holding different modalities of patient data, ii) centralized and local health entities collaborating on
multiple tasks, iii) learning without sharing labels, iv) multi-task split learning, v) multi-hop split learning** and other hybrid possibilities to name a few as shown below and further detailed in our paper here [(PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00564.pdf "Pdf")
